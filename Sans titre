I have several times heard that the choice of language does not really matter for greenIT, beyond the choice of compiled (C/C++/Go and also close behind JIT java or PHP) vs. interpretted (Python, Perl, Ruby). Indeed not so much in terms of CPU cost, but certainly so in terms of memory footprint. So a JIT compiled js code in V8, or a JIT compile similar piece of java, will not perform that different from a C++ version or an AOT version of the java.
