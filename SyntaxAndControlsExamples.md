For example a certain amount of comment is mandatory, link to the requirements and test cases are mandatory, or else the code does not compile. All these extra controls are implemented as compilation errors and are very relevant for business application developments: business systems are simple but have a large code base that often evolve to spagetthi unless sticktly managed. Here with DSLs, controls can come out of the box in the compilation process, without the cost of introducing code quality tools such as SonarQube in your nightly built and pipelines.
